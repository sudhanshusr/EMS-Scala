This is EMS Play application
=====================================

Framework	:	Play
FRM		:	Slick
Database	:	MySQL
FrontEnd	:	HTML/CSS

Note : Code is a Primary key so it should be unique.


SBT Configuration:

1) Install Sbt from ct-share "Utilities for all" or Just copy it from ALM_IS Sudhanshu_backup.

2) Configure environment variable :- add below to the path

C:\Program Files (x86)\sbt\bin;  

3) Check with "sbt --version" in CMD.


Database Configuration:

1) Go to EMS-Scala\app\models\DBUtils

2) Open DBUtils into text editor and change the IP of the JDBC URL to the machine IP where Database is to be installed.

3) Install MySQL to that machine.

4) Open MySQL Client and drop the Dump_Test.sql with \. prefix 

mysql> \. C:\Users\sudhanshusr\Desktop\EMS Scala\EMS-Scala\Dump_Test.sql

This will create database and add some dummy data.


Running Application:

1) Go to the application -> find build.sbt file , open CMD prompt on that location.

2) run sbt : this will take you to application sbt console

3) then run the following commands
     1) clean
	 2) compile
	 3) assembly
	 
4) "assembly" command  will create a jar.

5) Now go the location(target/scala2.0/) bearing the jar, just type 

java -jar jarname.jar

this will run the Application on localhost:9000


Issues Faced:

1) Make sure 9000 port is free. By default,sonarqube server runs on 9000.

2) Unable to resolve dependency:

Ask ALM_IS for the dependencies. I have shared it with the IS team.

Just Copy those to C:\Users\{yourusername}\.ivy2\cache
